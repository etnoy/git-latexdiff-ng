This is our humble attempt at making git-latexdiff better. We call it git-latexdiff-ng.

Authors: Jonathan Jogenfors and Jan-Åke Larsson, Linköping University.

Warning: This is a hack script we use internally for our own pleasure. Patches and suggestions are more than welcome!

Project page: https://github.com/etnoy/git-latexdiff-ng

To install: run 
make install
as root.

To use, just type
git latexdiff-ng

if your git document follows the latexmain standard. 

Otherwise, specify a main file:

git latexdiff-ng document.tex

By default, latexdiff-ng takes the previous revision of the source file. To override, use the -r option:
git latexdiff-ng -r 456b39d
